### Stakeholder Overview

<!--
This section should provide a brief overview of the changes and the motivation for the changes in a 
manner friendly to non-technical people and to technical people who don't know the context or are not
subject matter experts on the system or update being made. Consider the logical need for the change, 
as well as the logical effect of the change, particularly as any end-users would experience it.

Good example:
IHP is in the process of updating the way carts get built. This is the core cart creation 
logic that sorts and groups orders into carts. With the upcoming change for the UI, users will 
be able to skip the Press Staging Queue and create a cart based on the flash count for the 
printer they are selecting for.

Good example:
We are currently sending all pageViewTags as custom events to fullstory which results in Fullstory 
throttling Custom Events for our accounts. This prevents us from using custom events for more legitimate 
users (e.g. custom event to track when a user is in test group).
This change is going to help Swag Management to identify sessions of users in Swag Management test group.

Bad example:
